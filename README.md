# travel-time-maps

The goal of this project is to distort physical distance maps to more accuratly reflect travel time. This might sound like an "isochrone", but those are maps that only show travel time from a single origin. We want to have a map where all distances between any pair of points depicts travel time. We should point out that this is impossible for many reasons, but how close can we get?
